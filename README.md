My Preparations for the "macOS Control Bypasses (EXP-312-osmr)" Course By OffensiveSecurity.


[exp312 - At Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp312-osmr/)

Will include (NOT limited to):
 - High-Level Overview of the security (of Mac os's)
 - Binary analysis and experimentation
 - Both Kernel & User mode Shellcode (from scratch) (Including but not lim. to: Lua,Py3,C and BASH)
 - diff. Debuggers (Incl.)
 -  Ghidra - by the NSA
 -  ImmunityDBG and OllyDBG in Kali Linux
 -  Various forms of (code)Injection.
 -  Fully-Portable(and working out-of-the-box) POCS (Incl. Videos demonstrating how)
 
 
 I also decided to make some 
 ## Automation in the following Areas
 1. Note taking (Cherrytree, Joplin and trilium(avail. Here as well on GitHub: https://github.com/zadam/trilium )
 2. Code samples (Templates, so - it will be like using msfconsole, or PowershellEmpire - but for from scratch, specifically for Macs)
 3. many different ways (perspectives and methods of doing):
 4.   XPC Security
 5.   Symlink Security
 6.   AutoFInding (and, in other cases - AutoExploiting) Bugs
 7.   Fuzzing.
